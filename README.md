LLM-Based React Mini Project Comparison
Overview : 
This repository contains a comparison of two React mini applications (Flashcard App and To-Do List App) generated using ChatGPT and Claude. The goal was to analyze how different LLMs approach frontend development when given similar prompts.

Comparison Focus :
Component structure and modularity
State management using React hooks
Code organization and readability
Handling of assumptions and default behaviors

Key Observations :
Prompt specificity strongly affected output quality.
Clear constraints reduced unnecessary assumptions.
Claude tended to include additional UI features by default, while ChatGPT focused more on functional and minimal implementations.
Iterative prompting improved structural clarity and reusability in both cases.

Tech Stack :
React | JavaScript | CSS

Purpose : To understand how LLM behavior and prompt design influence code structure and development workflows.
