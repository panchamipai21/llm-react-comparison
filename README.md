LLM-Based React Mini Project Comparison Objective
This repository contains a comparative study of React-based mini applications generated using two large language models: ChatGPT and Claude. 
The goal was to understand how different LLMs approach frontend development tasks when provided with similar prompts.

Projects Included
Flashcard App (ChatGPT vs Claude)
To-Do List App (ChatGPT vs Claude)
Each application was generated separately using consistent prompts to observe differences in implementation style, structure, and reasoning.

Focus of Comparison
The comparison was based on:
Component structuring and modularity
State management using React hooks
Code readability and organization
Handling of assumptions and default behaviors
Clarity of explanation provided by the model

Observations
Prompt specificity significantly influenced output quality.
Clearly defined constraints reduced unnecessary assumptions
Iterative refinement improved structural clarity and reusability.
Differences were observed in how each model structured components and explained logic.
Majorly, Claude tended to include more built-in features and slightly more structured UI elements by default, whereas ChatGPT focused more on functional implementation 
with comparatively simpler styling. This highlighted differences in default assumptions and design orientation between the models.

Tech Stack
React
JavaScript
CSS

Purpose
This experiment was conducted to better understand how LLMs can assist in development workflows and how prompt design impacts code quality and architectural decisions.
